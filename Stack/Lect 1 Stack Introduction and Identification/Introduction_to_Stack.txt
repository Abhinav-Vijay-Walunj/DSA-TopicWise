Keywords to identify Problems based on the Stack.

1. Problem is related to Array
2. Problem Brute Force Approach  having 2 Nested 'for' Loop with Complexity O(n^2) and Inner 'for' Loop depends on Outer 'for' Loop (Consider 'i', 'j' iterators for Outer and Inner 'for' Loop. Then 'j' traversal range depends 'i')

Example:
Brute Force Approach Code has general syntax are follows

for(i = (0 .. n-1) or (n-1 .. 0)) {
    for(j = (0 .. i) or (i .. n-1) or (n-1 .. i) or (i .. 0)) {

    }
}
