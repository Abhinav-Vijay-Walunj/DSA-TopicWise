>> Spanning Tree:

A spanning tree is a tree in which we have N nodes(i.e. All the nodes present in the original graph) and N-1 edges and all nodes are reachable from each other via any path in Tree.

Note: Point to remember is that a graph may have more than one spanning trees.


>> Minimum Spanning Tree:

Among all possible spanning trees of a graph, the minimum spanning tree is the one for which the sum of all the edge weights is the minimum.

Note: There may exist multiple minimum spanning trees for a graph like a graph may have multiple spanning trees.


>> Algorithms to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a Graph are
1. Prim's Algorithm
2. Kruskal's Algorithm

Note: Kruskal's Algorithm require Disjoint Set Data Structure
