Types of Heap
1. Max Heap 
    i. Top of Heap is Maximum element.
    ii. Problems are Identified as: k + Smallest
    iii. Creation: priority_queue<dataType> maxHeap
2. Min Heap 
    i. Top of Heap is Minimum element.
    ii. Problems are Identified as: k + Largest
    iii. Creation: priority_queue<dataType, vector<dataType>, greater<dataType>> minHeap

Keywords to identify Problems based on the Heap.

1. k
2. Related to Smallest Element or Largest Element or Sorting the Elements

Important Notes
1. priority_queue STL has almost same the Methods and Attributes as Stack STL.
2. We can solve Problems of Heap by Sorting. 
3. Time Complexity if we solve Heap Problems using 
    i. Sorting Approach: O(n*log(n))
    ii. Heap Approach: O(n*log(k))

    Where k <= n. 
    Hence their is slightly decrease in Time Complexity if we Solve Heap Problems using Heap Approach.
