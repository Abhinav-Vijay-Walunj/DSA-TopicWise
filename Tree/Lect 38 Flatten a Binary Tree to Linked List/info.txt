Flatten a Binary Tree to Linked List
1. The sequence of nodes in the linked list should be the same as that of the preorder traversal of the binary tree.
2. The linked list nodes are the same binary tree nodes. You are not allowed to create extra nodes.
3. The right child of a node points to the next node of the linked list whereas the left child points to NULL.

3 Approaches for Flatten a Binary Tree to Linked List

1. Recursive Reverse Postorder Traversal
Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n)
2. Iterative Reverse Postorder Traversal
Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n)
3. Modified Morris Traversal
Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1)

Reverse Postorder is : Right Left Root
